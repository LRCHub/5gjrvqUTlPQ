There is a world I keep inside
When I'm with you I can't hide
You see everything
A part of me I can't disguise
I loose myself inside your eyes
'Cause you see everything

Everybody's searching for the one
And baby I've been waiting for so long
And now you undress me, you read my mind
Revealing my secrets that I've tried to hide
You've got that something, touching my soul
And when I'm around you, you make me whole
The way you caress me, you undress me

The thought of you makes me so strong
I know that I can't do no wrong
I could do anything
I cross the sea, I'll walk the moon
Just to spend the night with you
I could do anything

Everybody's searching for the one
And baby I've been waiting for so long
And now you undress me, you read my mind
Revealing my secrets, that I've tried to hide
You've got that something, touching my soul
And when I am around you, you make me whole
The way you caress me, you undress me

I'm naked before you, oh here I am
I'm naked before you, here I am

I've been searching for the one
At every turnin' I was wrong
Now I know where I belong
Now you undress me (ooh)
Yes now you undress me (oh ooh baby)
You make me whole
The way you undress me, you read my mind
Revealing my secrets that I've tried to hide
You've got that something touching my soul
And when I am around you, you make me whole
The way you caress me, you undress me
