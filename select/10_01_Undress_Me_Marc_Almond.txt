Undress me
Undress me
But not right away
Not too fast, eh!

Can you crave for me?
Desire me?
Enthral me

Undress me
Undress me
But don't be like the first time
Or go too crazy

First look at the truth
Take time to proceed
Don't be uncouth
Or show your greed
Devour me with your eyes
But be cautious
I'll become ravenous
By and by

Undress me
Deshabillez moi
But not right away
Not too fast, eh!

Can you hypnotise me?
Envelop me?
Capture me

Undress me
Undress me
But with some tact
And be exact
And dextrous

Choose your words with care
Control yourself, be strict
Not too slow nor quick
On my skin
There that's it, I'm trembling
And offer much to your expert touch
Oh, come on!

Undress me
Deshabillez moi
I want it right away
Go faster, it's okay
Can you possess me?
Consume me?
Burn me... up!

Undress me
Undress me
Behave like a lover
And be a lover
Do it!

Undress me
come on, undress me
And you... undress yourself
