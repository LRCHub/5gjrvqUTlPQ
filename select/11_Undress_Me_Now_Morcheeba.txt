Using your mind
Imagine our skin
Joined at the hip, joined from within
By using your eyes
You're freezing my frame
Watching our clothes burst into flames

(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your eyes now
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your mind, using your mind

So give me a light
Oh, give me a drink
Just give me a reason to feel what I think

(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your eyes now
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your mind

(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your eyes now
(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your mind, losing my mind

(Undress me now, you know how)
Using your eyes now
(Undress me now, you know how) oh
(You know how, you know how) whoo
You know how, you know how
